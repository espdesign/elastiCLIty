# _elastiCLIty_
elastiCLIty is a command line application designed to learn Linux commands with repetition.

The application use-case is designed around the idea that typing Linux commands repeatedly is helpful for retention.

## How it works:

elastiCLIty takes an input.`modules.json` and creates a menu system from the JSON data to choose a module.

Once a module is chosen, the script provides different modes to interact with that module's data.

    Available Modes:
    Learn : 
      Random questions: If the user gives the wrong answer, it displays the correct answer.
  
    Quiz: : 
      in development

### Customization:

Although this program was designed for Linux commands, you can create custom modules with any questions.

Edit the `modules.json` file to add your own.
